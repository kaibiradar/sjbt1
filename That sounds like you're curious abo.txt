That sounds like you're curious about **RAW Agency-style mental training** ‚Äî the kind of intense, elite training organizations give their students (possibly inspired by spy agencies, special ops, or intelligence units). While RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) ‚Äî India‚Äôs foreign intelligence agency ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt publicly disclose training methods, we can build an accurate picture based on intelligence training techniques used globally (like by RAW, CIA, MI6, Mossad, etc.).

Here‚Äôs a fictionalized but realistic breakdown of how **RAW or a similar elite agency** might train its recruits **mentally, psychologically, and strategically** to be smarter, sharper, and better decision-makers.
